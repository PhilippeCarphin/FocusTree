A call stack for the mind.

Focus tree is a program that I developed to help me benefit from ideas that can
be seen in a call stack in the area of keeping my focus.

If I'm making a commit and I have to look up the repo maintainer's instructions
on how they want commit messages to be, then what happens when we have found
that info is that we return from that function call to the task that initiated
the lookup.
